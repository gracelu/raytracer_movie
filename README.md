raytracer_movie
===============
Code written for final project of CS 152 class taken Winter 2014 quarter. Project involved writing code to create a ray tracer and then making hundreds of frames that could be compiled into a movie using ffmpeg.

Both coloring and size of spheres are determined by functions. One example of a coloring function for a sphere is generating RGB values using the sin and cos of the distance to the center of the sphere in regards to location in the frame. One possible sizing function is dividing the radius of the sphere by a fraction of the frame number.
